## Setup and Installation

### Requirements

- **Max/MSP 8.0+** with JavaScript support
- **Modern Web Browser** (for visual rendering)
- **Graphics Card** with OpenGL 2.0+ support
- **4GB RAM** minimum (8GB recommended)

### Installation Steps

1. Copy `AI-Prompt-MIDI-Visual.amxd` to your Live User Library
2. Ensure `visual-generator.js` is in the Max patch search path
3. Load the device on a MIDI track in Ableton Live
4. Click "Start Visuals" to initialize the visual engine

### Troubleshooting

#### Visuals Not Appearing

- Check Max/MSP console for JavaScript errors
- Verify browser security settings allow local canvas access
- Ensure graphics drivers are up to date

#### Poor Performance

- Reduce Visual Intensity setting
- Lower Music Reactivity to reduce processing load
- Close unnecessary applications
- Check CPU usage in system monitor

#### Color Issues

- Verify prompt contains mood/color keywords
- Try different visual styles
- Check if custom color palettes are loaded correctly

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Color Palettes

You can extend the device with custom color schemes by modifying the `visual-generator.js` file:

```javascript
const customPalettes = {
  sunset: ["#FF6B35", "#F7931E", "#FFD23F", "#FF8C42"],
  ocean: ["#006994", "#13A3D6", "#87CEEB", "#40E0D0"],
  forest: ["#228B22", "#32CD32", "#98FB98", "#00FF7F"],
};
```

### MIDI Integration

The visual system responds to:

- **Note On/Off**: Triggers particle bursts and color changes
- **Velocity**: Controls visual intensity and brightness
- **Pitch**: Influences particle position and movement
- **Timing**: Synchronizes animations with musical rhythm

### Performance Features

- **Live Mode**: Optimized for real-time performance
- **Recording Mode**: Higher quality for video capture
- **Fullscreen Projection**: For live concerts and installations
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Span visuals across multiple displays

## Creative Tips
